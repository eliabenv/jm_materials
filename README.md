Hi!

These are the materials I used for my Econ Job Market applications in 2024/2025.

The PDFs I've included are for the application to a postdoc at Rockwool Foundation Berlin, but they are meant to be general and include some materials not usually required for postdocs (diversity statement and teaching statement). I've also included the slides deck for my Job Talk at NHH Bergen.

If you need any help, advice or want to request additional material, contact me at eliabenv@gmail.com!

GOOD LUCK! YOU ARE GOING TO DO WELL!!
