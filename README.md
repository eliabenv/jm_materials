Hi!

These are the materials I used for my Econ Job Market applications in 2024/2025.

I included 3 cover letters. One for an AP position (UIB Palma), one for a postdoc (RFBerlin) and one for policy-academic (NY FED). Compared to cover letters for postdocs, AP cover letters have one extra paragraph about teaching and policy-academic cover letters have one extra paragraph about how my work is policy-relevant. I don't think that this is very important, I did it because the template I used did it this way.

I've also included the slides deck for my Job Talk at NHH Bergen.

If you need any help, advice or want to request additional material, contact me at eliabenv@gmail.com!

GOOD LUCK! YOU ARE GOING TO DO WELL!!
