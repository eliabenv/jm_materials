Hi!

These are the materials I used for my Econ Job Market applications in 2024/2025.

The particular PDFs I've included are for the application I made for a postdoc at Rockwool Foundation Berlin, but they are meant to be a general template. I've also included the slides deck for my Job Talk at NHH Bergen.

If need any help, advice or want additional material, contact me at eliabenv@gmail.com!

GOOD LUCK! YOU ARE GOING TO DO WELL!!
